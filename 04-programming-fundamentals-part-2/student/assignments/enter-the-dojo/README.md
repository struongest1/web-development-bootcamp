# Enter The Dojo

To get better at coding it's important to exercise, and type things out, try them out in the REPL and play around with different methods available. To find ample exercises, we're going to tap into the [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) website. The exercises are called kata, and they're a great way to get a better handle on writing code that addresses different problems!
