# Working Together: Writing Bad Poetry

This assignment is meant to get your comfortable with navigating using the terminal, and learning how to work collaboratively using git.

## Before going further please configure your github locally:

* [Generate SSH keys and connect them to your account](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys)

## Assignment Instructions
To complete this exercise, please split into groups of 3 or 4, and have the person with the longest name create a repository on their github. 

1. The longest-named person creates the repository (with a README file - there will be a checkbox that says 'Initialize this repository with a README' when you're creating the repository - check this box) and invites everyone in their group to the repository
2. Everyone clones the repository to their machine using `git clone`
3. You take turns adding a line of poetry to the poem by using a combination of `git pull`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`
