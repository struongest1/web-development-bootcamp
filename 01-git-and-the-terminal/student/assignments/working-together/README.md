# Working Together: Writing Excellent Poetry

This assignment is meant to get your comfortable with navigating using the terminal, and learning how to work collaboratively using git.

## Before going further please configure your github locally:
* [Configure Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#set-up-git)
* [Generate SSH keys and connect them to your account](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys)

## Assignment Instructions
To complete this exercise, please split into groups of 3 or 4, and have the person with the longest name create a repository on their github. 

1. The longest-named person creates the repository (with a README file - there will be a checkbox that says 'Initialize this repository with a README' when you're creating the repository - check this box) and invites everyone in their group to the repository
2. Navigate to the 'web-development-bootcamp/01-git-and-the-terminal/student/assignments/working-together'
3. Create a directory called 'my-working-together'
4. Clone the repository which was created in step 1 to your machine using `git clone` (make sure to use SSH and not HTTPS)
5. Take turns adding a line of poetry to the README.md by using a combination of `git pull`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` (if everything goes well, in that particular order)
