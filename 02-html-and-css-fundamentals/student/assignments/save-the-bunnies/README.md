# Save The Bunnies: A Simple Web Page

In this assignment, you will be flexing your CSS and HTML skills, and of course, saving bunnies.

## Assignment Instructions
For this assignment, you will be creating a simple web page to promote and help find owners for bunnies which recently got to the shelter. Your website will have a simple navigation, two pages (home and contact) you can toggle between, and some content. Below is a mockup of the web pages you can use as a reference, but feel free to get creative, just make sure you don't expand the **scope** of the assignment too much.

1. Create a repository called 'saving-bunnies' on your GitHub
2. Clone the repository locally
3. Start creating your webpage
    * You will need an `index.html` and `contact.html` file
    * Create a `styles.css` for all your CSS
4. When you are ready, add your progress to the GitHub repo by using the `git` commands we learned in the previous lesson (refer to the lesson if you need to remember the commands, or google a cheatsheet for git commands)
5. Create a [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) account, and [deploy your webpage](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/) so you can share it with others. It's free! (Tip: you don't need a build command for this particular project when deploying it to Netlify)
